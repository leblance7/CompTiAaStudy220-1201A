Series of Moving Vans
        +Efficiently move large amounts of data.
                - Use a shipping truck.
        + The network of topology Protocol(IP).
                -Roads designed for this truck.
        + The boxes hold your data
                - Bocrd of TCP and UDP. + Inside the boxes are more things. - Application information. IP - Internet Protocol
[__ Ethernet Header => Ethernet Payload <= Ethernet Trailer__]
[__ Ethernet Header => IP ||| IP Payload <= Ethernet Trailer__]
[__Ethernet Header => IP ||| TCP ||| TCP Paylaod <= Ethernet
        Trailer__]
[__ Ethernet Header => IP ||| TCP ||| HTTP Data <= Ethernet 
        Trailer__]
        + Internet Protocol Nesting order.
        - Ethernet Header #1 [ IP(IP Payload) #2 [TCP 
        (TCP Payload)[ TCP HTTP data ]]] Ethernet Trailer.

TCP and UDP
        + Transported inside of IP.     
                - Encapsulated by the IP protocol.
        + Two ways to move data from place to place.
                - Different features for different applications.
        + OSI Layer 4
                - The Transport layer.
        + Multiplexing
                - Use many different appialications.
                - TCP and UDP.
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
        + Connectoin - oriented.
                - A formal connection setup and close.
        + A "Reliable" delivery
                - Recovery from errors.
                - Can manage out-of-order messages or
                        retransmissions.
        + Flow control
                - Receiver can manage how much data is sent.
                *Computer => TCP Data => Server*
                *Computer <= TCP ACK <= Server*
UDP - User Datagram Protocol
        + Connectionless
                - No formal open or close the connection.
        + "Unreliable" delivery
                - No error recovery
                - No reordering of data of retransmissions.
        + No Flow Control
                - Sender determines the amount of data
                        transmitted.
        *Computer ==> UDP Data == > Server*
Why would you ever use UDP?
        + Real - time communication
                - There's no way to stope and resend the data.
                - Time doesn't stop for your network.
                - Ex. Videocalling.
        +Connectionless Protocols
                - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol)
                - TFTP (Trivial FILE Transfer protocol)
        + The Data may not get through
                - Applciation keeps track and decides what
                        to do.
Communication using TCP
        + Connection-oriented protocls prefer a "return Receipt"
               -HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
               - SSH(Secure Shell).
        +Applicatoin doesn't worry anout out of order frames
                or missing data.
                -TCP handles all of the communication overhead.
                -Application has one job.
Speedy Delivery
        +IP delivery truck driver from one (IP) Address to
                (IP) Address.
                - Every house has IP address, every computer has an IP address.
        + Boxes arrive at the housr / IP address
                -Where do the boxes go?
                -Each box has a a room name.
        + Port is written on the outside of the box.
                -Drop the box into the right room.
                EX. Apartment numbers in a complex.
Lots of Ports
        +IPV4 sockets
                -Server IP address, protocol, server application port number.
                - Client Ip address, protocl mclient port number.
        + Non-ephemeral ports - permanant port numbers
                - Ports 0 through 1023.
                - Usually on a server or service.
        + Ephemerial ports - temporary port bumbers
                - Ports 1024 through 65535
                - Determined in real time by the client.
Port Numbers
        + TCP and UDP ports can be any between 0 and 65535.
        + Most Servers(services) use non-epehhmeral(permant) port
                numbers.
                - Isn't always the case, just a number.
        + Port numbers are for communication, not security.
        + Service port numbers need to be "well known"/
        + TCP port numbers aren;t he same as UDP port numbers.
Ports on the Network
        + Web server - tcp/80
        + VoIP server udp/5004
        + Email servree - tcp/143
        Client, IP Address: 10.0.0.1 => <= Server, 
                IP Address 10.0.0.2
                EH => IP | TCP | HTTP data <= ET 
                EH => IP | UDP | VoIP data <= ET
                EH => IP | TCP | Email data <= ET
                - Each of the IP will have the same Source
                        IP 10.0.0.1 and Destination IP 10.0.0.2
                
        Source IP: 10.0.0.1 | TCP Source Port = 3000 | HTTP Data
        Dest IP 10.0.2  | TCP Desp Port = 80         | HTTP Data
        ========================================================
        . . . UDP Source Port = 7100 | VoIP data
        . . . UDP Desp Port = 5004   | VoIP data
        ========================================================= 
        . . . TCP Source Port = 4407 | Email Data
        . . . TCP Desp Port = 143    | 143
