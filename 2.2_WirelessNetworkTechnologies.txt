Wireless technologies
        + IEEE standards
                -Insitiue of electrail and Elcrionics Engineers
                - 802.11 committee
                - Everyone follows these standards.
        + Also reference as a generation.
                - 802.11 is Wi- fi 5
                - 802.11ax is wi-fi 6 and Wi - Fi 6e (extended).
                - 802.11be is Wi - fi 7
                - Future version will increment accordingly.
802.11 technologies     
        + Frequencies 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, 6GHz
                - Sometimes a combination.
        + Channels
                - Froups of frwuencies, numbered by the IEEE
                - Frequencies, nare managed ny governing entities.
                - Using non-overlapping channels would be optimal.
        + Bandwidth
                - Amount of frequency in use
                - 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz etc.
Band selection and bandwidth:

        6ghz   
                - Goes up to 160 and 320 GHz bandwidth
Bluetooth
        + Removes the wires
                - Headsets speakers, Keyboards / Mice
        + Uses the 2.4 GHz range
                - Unlincsed ISM
                        (Industiral, Scientifiic and Medical) band.
                - Same as 802.11
        +Short - range
                - Most consumer devices operate to about 10 meters
RFID (Radio -frequency identification)
        -everywhere
                - access badhes 
                -inventory . assembl line tracking
                -pet / animal identification
        + Radar technology
                - Radio energy transmitted into the tag.
                - RF power the tag, ID is transmitted back
                -Bidireftional communication
                - some tag formats can be active / powered
NFC (Near Field communication_
        + Two - way wirelss communication
                - BUilds on RFID , which is mostlu one - way.
        + Payment systmes 
                - major credit cards
                - Online wallets
        +Bootstrap for other wireless
                -NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing.
