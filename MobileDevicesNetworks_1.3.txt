Celluar Networks
        +Mobile Devices:
                - "Cell" Phones
        + Seperate land into "cells"
                -Operate by having Anntenie seperating networks into cells.
        +Enable or disbale voice and/or data.
                - Airplane mode disables all celluar networks.
                - Could also disable date but keep voice.

3G tech
        - #rd generation
                -INtroduced in 1998
        + Upgraded data connectivity
                -Incremental #G updates imporved speeds.
                - Usually several megabits persecond.
        Bandwidth Improvement allowed new functionality
                -GPS
                -Mobile Televsion
                -Videos on demand and video conferences.
4G and LTE
        +Long Term Ecolution(LTE)
                -A 4g tech
                -Based on GSM (GLobal System for mobile communications) and EDGE(Enhacned Data Rates for
                        GSM evolution)
        +LTE Advanced 
                -Standard suports download rates of 300Mbit/s
5G
        +5th generatoin celluar networking 
                -Launched worlwide in 2020       
        + Signigicant performance improvements
                -At higher frequencies
                - Eventually 10 gigabits persecond
                - Slower speeds from 100 - 900 Mbit/s
        +Signigicant loT impact
                - Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint.
                - Larger Data Transfers.
                - Faster monitoring and notifaction.
                - Additional cloud processing.
Wi-FI
        + Connect to a local 802.11 network
                -data for email and internet
                - higher speeds, no celluar badnwidth use
        +requires a local access point
                 - Limited distances coverage.
        + May also cover voice communication.
                - Wi-fi calling
                - Requires support from teh voice carrier.
                - Very useful when celluar coverage may not be availble.

Hotspot
        +turm your phone into a EWgi hotspot
                -own personal wireless router
                -extend the ceulluar date network to all of your devices
        + dependant on the phone type and your provider.
                - may rewyire additonal chrages and data costs.

SIM Subscriber Idenity Module
        + A unique indentifier for ceullar decives
                - Often a tiny phyical card
                - Replace SIm and the hone has a new number
        + Contains information for teh carrier and user
                -SIM id and iphone bymber
                - Celluar netowrk information
                -Storage space for contacts, messages, etc
        + eSim - embedded Sim
                -Sim is insdie the device
                - Cannot be physically removes
                - Many deives suport multiple SIMs.

Bluetooth Pairing
        + Conncet a Bluetooth device
                -Built-in security
                - Usr or berigy a PIN
        +Pair the devices one time
                -Furture connections should be automatic.
Bluetooth Pairing Success       
        +enable Bluetooth on borh devices.
                -Android and Iod: Seetins and Bluetooth
        Set Devices to disoverable mode
                - May rewuie key seuwnces on bluetooth device.
        +Set discoverable device.
                -many devices may appear.
        + Enter or confirm PIN
                -Should be the same on both devices.
        +Test Connectivity
                - Devices should now communicate.
GPS( Global Positioning System)
        +Createad by US department of defence.
                - 30 satalites in orbit.
        Precise navigation on alteast 4 satellites.
        + Determines location basdd on timing differences:
                -Longitude, latitude, and altitude.
        + Mobile Devices location serivces and Geotracking:
                -Maps,  directions
                - Determine physical location based on GPS, WIFI, and celluar towers.
